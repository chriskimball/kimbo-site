# Code Refactor - Horiseon Social Solution Services


## Contributor - Chris Kimball


### Description
---------------
The following project is the refactoring of code for the main website of the company, <strong>Horiseon Social Solution Services</strong>. 
The previous build of the Horiseon's website did not meet standard accessiblility guidelines, contained a broken section link, and had several areas of redundant code and styling.
The content, function, and styling of the website remained the same in the new build.
This new build includes the following improvements:
* Clear and concise webpage title was added to improve search engine optimization
* Increased accessibility by inclusion of ``alt`` image descriptions
* Restructured html content to have semantic html structure, including a clear ``header`` with ``nav`` links, with ``main`` and ``aside`` content separated into clear ``sections`` and ``footer`` that contains copyright and site credits.
* This improved semantic html structure will allow for better accessibility in addition to improving the company's search engine optimization.
* The css for the website has been consolidated into semantic elements rather than multiple redundant ``classes`` and ``ids``.
* The css properties follow the logical order of the semantic html structure to allow for consistent styling for similar elements in future builds.
* Clear and concise comments have been left throughout both html and css markup to allow other developers to clearly identify each section of the website and relevant styling.
